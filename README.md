#  Tortuosity and Transient Permeability Computations from 3D FIB-SEM Images. 
Streamlines-based approach is developed to compute tortuosity based on three-dimensional pore geometry constructed from FIB-SEM images. Also, permeability was calculated based on transient simulation with varying mesh sizes. 

#  Getting Started
openFOAM needs to be installed first. This work is developed under OpenFOAM-v1706.  
More information regarding openFOAM can be found on https://openfoam.com/releases  

Paraview needs to be also installed to visualize tortuosity data  
More information about ParaView can be found here https://www.paraview.org/ 

The shale sample used in the analysis is available on request.

# Abstract
Recent advancements in computational geosciences and pore-scale imaging have
made it possible to extract three-dimensional pore geometries from tight rock samples
such as shale. This study presents a viable mean to determine elusive transport
properties of tight reservoirs using techniques from Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD). We present novel numerical procedure to compute hydraulic tortuosity in a
complex 3D pore system imaged by Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope
(FIB-SEM). The effectiveness of the procedure is demonstrated on a pore network that
was extracted from a shale reservoir in the United States. Results suggest log-normal
distribution of tortuosity with an average of 1.8 which illustrate the highly convoluted
pathways of fluid diffusion through shale reservoirs. Additionally, permeability was
computed at 10 sub-volumes of the original shale sample to investigate the size of
permeability Representative Elementary Volume (REV). Permeability computations
were conducted using finite volume method and under the consideration of transient
incompressible Newtonian fluid. Findings reveal that a shale sample of 7.44 cubic
micron is insufficient to reach permeability REV. Lastly, we carried out mesh density
sensitivities, for the first time on a shale sample, to examine the reliability of using 3D
pore networks extracted from FIB-SEM stacks.
